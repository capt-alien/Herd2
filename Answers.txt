Please note the large simulation files were too big to push to github.
Files available by request please email me at eric.botcher@students.makeschool.com


1) What were the inputs you gave the simulation?
(Population size, percent vaccinated, virus name, mortality rate, basic reproductive rate)

 simulation.py 10000 0.90 Ebola 0.10 0.25 10


2) What percentage of the population became infected at some point before the virus burned out?
       6%

3) What percentage of the population died from the virus?

      .6% died
4) Out of all interactions sick individuals had during the entire simulation, how many total
 interactions did we see where a vaccination saved a person from potentially becoming infected?

      540 interactions with vaccinated people.
